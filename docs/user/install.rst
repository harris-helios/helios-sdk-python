Installation
============

Source Code
-----------
Currently, the package only exists on GitHub.

You can clone the public repository::

    $ git clone https://github.com/harris-helios/helios-sdk-python.git
    
At this point it is a good idea to add the HeliosSDK package to your **PYTHONPATH**.
This will allow you to :code:`import helios` from any location.

Dependencies
------------
* Python 2 or 3
* requests
* pillow
* numpy
* python-dateutil
