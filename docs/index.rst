Helios-SDK-Python
=================

Asynchronous Python SDK for the Helios APIs.

HeliosÂ® weather analytics from Harris Corporation provide fast and 
accurate local ground weather intelligence to assist organizations 
with real-time decision making. Helios analyzes content from 
thousands of existing public and private video cameras, providing 
immediate confirmation of ground weather condition changes at a 
detailed local level.  For more details, refer to `helios.earth 
<https://helios.earth/>`_.

The Helios SDK brings the core API functionality along with 
extensions to Python. Many of the capabilities are thread-enabled
allowing for batch jobs.  The overall goal is to provide the 
tools necessary to quickly begin using the Helios product.

For further developer information, refer to 
`the Helios developer documentation. <https://helios.earth/developers/>`_
